* link anonymous to account
* login with facebook, google, github
* transforms for attr
* tests for query computed
* model, array fragments
* firebase session
* firebase storage
* fastboot shoebox for models, documents, query states
* transient computed property should have `{ type: single / array }`
* match computed property sorting
