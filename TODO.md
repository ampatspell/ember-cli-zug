# TODO

* figure out api for session and storage so that I have a better understanding regarding exports
* transforms for attr
* tests for query computed
* model, array fragments
* firebase session
* firebase storage
* fastboot shoebox for models, documents, query states
* transient computed property should have `{ type: single / array }`
* match computed property sorting
* queries computed property which merges multiple query states (isLoading, isError, errrors) (and additional promises?)
